Need to merge and clean the dataset:
Merging the datasets may require extensive computing power so Argo was used

00 Merge Data.py *This code shows how the data set was merged using python.

The dataset was cleaned to remove the outliers and unwanted attributes.

01 Clean Data new.py
This code shows how the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using python.

Data Exploration with R/Rstuido:

Mapping.R
This code was used for the data mapping done in R.

Plots.R
This code is for the plots that were created in R as part of the analysis.

Preparation for modeling:

Data_Prepared_for_Modeling.R
This code is for the data that was prepared for analysis in R.

Modeling Code:

ATASH(SVM, NN, RF).R
This is the code for the SVM, NN, RF analysis methods in R.

Data Exploration with Python:

02 Visualize Cleaned Data.py
This code was used for creating visualizations to see cleaned data using python.

Modeling with Python:

06 Time Series with weekday arr dep delays.py
This code was used to do a time series analysis looking the arrival and departure delays using python.

07 Kmean Clustering.py
This code was used to perform Kmeans clustering analysis using python.

08 Time Series with weekday arr dep delays (Categorical).py
This code was used to conduct time series analysis with weekday arrival and departure delays with addition of Categorical analysis using python.
